        <li>Provide your name, major, year in school

                Hi! I'm Galen Hicks, a Communication Design major, class
                of 2023
            </p>
           
        <h3>
            <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what 
            prompted you to take this class. </li>
        </h3>
            <p>This class is required for my major, but also I have an
                interest in web design. I would also like to know at least
                a little bit of a coding language by the time I leave 
                WashU, such as JavaScript.
            </p>
        <h3>
            <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? 
            If so, tell us a bit about it. </li>
        </h3>

            <p>In my freshman year I remember doing a little bit with HTML
                and CSS, but I think I forgot most of that.
            </p>
        <h3>
            <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class. </li>
        </h3>
        <p>I hope to learn the basics of creating a website; I would 
            also like to be able to get through the basics without having
            to do too much Googling.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be 
            different from designing for paper. </li>
        </h3>

            <p>I think that designing for screen will be a lot different
                 because you can't just move things around and touch things 
                 up as easily. Every move has to agree with the rest of the 
                 "code" or it won't work.
            </p>

        <h3>    
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective
             design. Explain your choice. </li>
        </h3>

             <p> I think that (https://www.netflix.com/) is a well designed website. It 
                 looks really good without sacrificing its usability, and the way that the sections of the browse
                  page are broken down into rows looks good and also effectively divides everything in a useful manner.
             </p>

        <h3>
             <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective 
            communication. Explain your choice. </li>
        </h3>

            <p>(https://mail.google.com/) is an example of a website with good communication. I really appreciate Gmail because there aren't 
                a lot of unnecessary elements. The folders, (eg. sent, starred, inbox) are all necessary and relay the exact contents or what's inside of them.
                You can add folders as you please, but only the essentials are present as a default.
            </p>

        <h3>    
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. 
            Explain your choice. </li>
        </h3>
        
            <p> (https://www.amazon.com/) I think this is a website that works
                pretty well. It is easy to use, simple, and intuitive. I don't 
                like how it looks, but I seldom have trouble navigating it and using
                it which is the first thing I think you should worry about when 
                creating a website.
